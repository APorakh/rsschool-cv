## Code example

### Simple calculator in Python

Takes the first number, takes arithmetic sign then takes the second number. If the sign is “/” and the second number is 0 then program returns “You can't divide on 0”. In other cases, it performs calculations with given numbers

<span style=color:#6cb8cc>first = int(input()) <br>
symbol = input() <br>
second = int(input()) <br>
  <br>
if symbol == "/" and second == 0: <br>
print("You can't divide on 0") <br>
else: <br>
if symbol == "+": <br>
   result = first + second <br>
if symbol == "-": <br>
   result = first - second <br>
if symbol == "_": <br>
   result = first _ second <br>
if symbol == "/": <br>
